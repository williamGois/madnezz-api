## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: GO User Access
```bash
# GO can access all levels
GO_TOKEN="..." # Get from login

# ‚úÖ Should work - GO can access GO dashboard
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/organization/dashboard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GO_TOKEN"

# ‚úÖ Should work - GO can access GR dashboard
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/regional/dashboard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GO_TOKEN"

# ‚úÖ Should work - GO can access Store dashboard
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/store/dashboard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GO_TOKEN"

# ‚úÖ Should work - GO has all departments
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/reports/financial" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GO_TOKEN"
```

```

### Scenario 3: Store Manager Access
```bash
# Store Manager has most limited access
SM_TOKEN="..." # Get from login

# ‚ùå Should fail - SM cannot access GO dashboard

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SM_TOKEN"

# ‚ùå Should fail - SM cannot access GR dashboard
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/api/v1/regional/dashboard" \

*Requires Marketing department access

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Notes

### Middleware Stack
1. `jwt.auth` - JWT authentication validation
2. `org.context` - Organization context injection
3. `hierarchy.access:level,department` - Hierarchy and department validation

### Hierarchy Levels
- **GO (Director)**: Highest level, manages entire organization
- **GR (Regional Manager)**: Manages regional units and stores
- **Store Manager**: Manages individual stores

### Departments
- **Administrative**: General administration
- **Financial**: Financial control and accounting
- **Marketing**: Marketing and communication
- **Operations**: Operations and logistics
- **Trade**: Trade marketing and sales
- **Macro**: Strategic macro planning

### Access Rules
1. Higher hierarchy levels inherit access from lower levels
2. Department access is role-specific and non-inherited
3. Resource access is automatically validated based on organizational hierarchy
4. GO users have access to all departments by default
5. GR users have access to operational departments
6. Store Managers have access to store-level departments only

## üîí Security Features

- **JWT-based authentication** with token expiration
- **Multi-layered access control** (hierarchy + department + resource)
- **Automatic context injection** for organizational data
- **Domain-Driven Design** architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **Value objects** for type safety and business rule enforcement
- **Repository pattern** for data access abstraction
